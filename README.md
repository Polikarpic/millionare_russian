This is my small project, small game created "just for fun"
I`m developed that for education and realization my small idea. 
8 years ago I played in some game, where I must earn some money in the game.
Features of that:

1) I have a small start money
2) to ern more money I must buy and sell some things like oil, gold, land, working and buy some things like flats, houses, machines.

I think that this game was little small and imperfect. It was writed on VB.NET

I write my own project on C#.NET
I added that feaucter:

In the game may be happen unhappy things:

your flat is burned, your your land had corrupted and other...

I`m working on the project because I want create online project like that.
I`m writing expansion for that program and create a server, that process and serve clients

It will be a big client-server application
In the first - on Windows, and in the future - on Linux platforms/
